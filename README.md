# Data-Science
# ðŸ“ŠData Science Learning Journey
Welcome to my Data Science Repository! ðŸš€
This repository documents my journey in Data Science, covering everything from Python fundamentals to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Generative AI, and Power BI.

I will be learning each concept thoroughly and implementing real-world projects to strengthen my skills. This repository will serve as a guide for anyone looking to follow a structured Data Science learning path.
